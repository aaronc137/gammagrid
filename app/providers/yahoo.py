"""Yahoo Finance via yfinance — the default provider.

Moved here from collector.py and reshaped into a class; no behaviour changed in
the move. Same per-expiry retry granularity, same column renaming, same column
order.

This is the source that requires nothing from you — no account, no token, no
card — and it stays the default for exactly that reason. Its limitations are
real and documented in the README: the API is unofficial, the data is delayed,
and there is no SLA. That is the trade a free default makes.

# chain, the spot and the price history all come from that one symbol.
#
# THE CARET FORM IS THE CBOE INDEX, NOT THE PUBLISHER'S QUOTE. `^GSPC` and
# `^DJI` are the S&P 500 and the Dow as their publishers quote them, and Yahoo
# serves no option chain under either — 0 expiries, measured on yfinance 1.7.0
# — which is how this product once concluded that Yahoo has no index options
# at all. Under `^SPX`, `^XSP`, `^NDX`, `^RUT` and `^DJX` it serves 53, 42, 40,
# 28 and 12 expiries, dailies included. And `^DJI` is not even DJX's price:
# DJX is written on one hundredth of the Dow, so the old `DJX → ^DJI` mapping
# would have put a spot a hundred times too high under every greek.
#
# SPOT AND CHAIN FROM THE SAME SYMBOL, deliberately. Cboe's index quotes at
# Yahoo are delayed about fifteen minutes, like the chain; a publisher's quote
# can be fresher, and pricing a delayed chain against a fresher spot moves
# every strike's moneyness by however far the index travelled in between.
#
# ONE TRANSLATION, IN ONE PLACE. The sibling product learned this the expensive
# way: the map was wired into the spot lookup alone, and the price-history
# lookup then failed with "possibly delisted; no price data found" for every
# index ticker. Nothing crashed, because that caller swallows failures and
# returns nothing — so realized volatility was simply absent, with no symptom.
# One translation used in one of two places is the same bug twice.
